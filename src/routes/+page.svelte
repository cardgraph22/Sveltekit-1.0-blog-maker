<h4>Welcome to </h4>
<pre>
<p>This project is intended for Sveltekit 1.0 developers.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to demonstrate recursive nested blog replies using svelte:self</p>
<p>The documentation is in the README.MD file on github.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, it uses MongoDB with Mongoose (if you're interested).</p>
<p>As a double added bonus, it show how to upload images (/userForm)</p>
<p>So click 'List Blogs', then click the conversation icon under the user to reveal comments/replies.</p>
<p>Then play around with the code and have fun!</p>
<p>NB - This is still a work in progress: better css, authentication, et al</p>
